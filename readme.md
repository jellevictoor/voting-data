# Visualizing voting in the Belgian federal parliament (chamber)

This project visualizes the voting behavior of the politicians in the Belgian federal parliament (Chamber) in 2024.

## First prototype: textual summary of recent voting behavior

As a first visualization, the fetched voting behavior is summarized as text in https://github.com/transparentdemocracy/voting-data/tree/main/data/output, per plenary session in the Chamber.


## Next prototype: a voting quiz

The first full prototype we are aiming at, is a voting quiz that helps you decide which political party and individual politicians represented best your own preferences.

This as opposed to most voting quizes in the Belgian media currently, except for De Morgen / HLN, and with the added benefit of being able to understand which individual politicians are most aligned with your preferences.

## Convinced of this project's potential?
